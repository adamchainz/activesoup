# activesoup

A headless pure-python browser for the web

:warning: This package is not yet ready for prime-time.

## Description

`activesoup` combines familiar python web capabilities for convenient headless browsing functionality:
* Modern HTTP support with [requests](http://www.python-requests.org/) - connection pooling, sessions, ...
* Convenient access to the web page with [beautifulsoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) - convenient HTML navigation
* Robust HTML parsing with [html5lib](https://html5lib.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) - parse the web like browsers do

## Use cases

Consider using `activesoup` when:
* You need to actively interact with some web-page from python (e.g. submitting forms, downloading files)
* You don't control the site you need to interact with (if you do, just make an API)
* You don't need javascript support (consider a heavierweight solution, like [selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/))
